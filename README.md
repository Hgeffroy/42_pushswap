# Push Swap Project Readme

## Overview

Welcome to the Push Swap project! This project is part of the 42 school curriculum, designed to enhance your algorithmic and sorting skills. In Push Swap, you are tasked with sorting a stack of integers using a specific set of operations with the goal of using as few moves as possible.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of the Push Swap project are as follows:

1. **Sorting Algorithm**: Implement an efficient sorting algorithm to arrange a stack of integers in ascending order.

2. **Limited Set of Operations**: Use a restricted set of operations to manipulate the stack, including swapping the first two elements, pushing an element from one stack to another, and rotating the stack.

3. **Minimize Moves**: Minimize the number of moves required to sort the stack.

4. **Error Handling**: Properly handle errors, such as invalid input or incorrect usage of operations.

## Usage

Building and Running
To build the Push Swap program, use the provided Makefile:

```bash
Copy code
make
```
This will generate the push_swap and checker executables.

To run the program, use the following command format:

```bash
./push_swap [list of integers]
```

Example:

```bash
./push_swap 4 2 7 1 5
```
This will output a series of operations to sort the stack.

## Sorting Algorithms

I tried several sorting algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort, RADIX sort, ... In the end i implemented my own one.
